#] WELCOME
This is PRIZMATIC - The API wrapper for Discord, Riot, Reddit, and more.
The bar on the far left or far top is the files index, there may be some scroll time.
The the other bar is the sections on this page, tap it to jump there.

#] WORKINGS
How does the documentation work? Well, none of this is automatically generated. Everything \
is typed by hand. I made my own version of MarkDown to support cool formatting.

--docs--
#] HOW STUFF IS DOCUMENTED
Generally, in files, it will be documented with the following template:
CODE---
DOCUMENTATION ---
    Description of the class

PARAMS ---
    param\_name [param_type]
    - Description of this param, eg what it does
    .
    .
    .
    >> If a class shouldn't be initialized by hand, a message will be there instead

FUNCTIONS ---
    function(...)
    - What this function does
    
    function(...) -> type
    - What this function does
---
Also, to get a specific file, add `?{file\_name}` to the url where `{file\_name}` is what is shown in the far left/top bar
Additionally, to get a specific section, add `#{sect\_name}` where `{sect\_name}` is what is shown in the other bar

#] HOW THIS FLAVOR OF MARKDOWN WORKS
Unfortunately, there are no tables. Then again, who uses tables for code?
Anyway here are the available styles:
*\*ital\** #\#bold\## ~\~strike\~~ _\_under\__ \\\*escape\* `\`inline-code\`` |\|spoil\|| ^\^super\^^ %\%sub\%%

Tip: You can throw a `\\` anywhere and it will literally print that character
