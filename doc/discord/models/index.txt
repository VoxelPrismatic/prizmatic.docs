NOTE---
Almost all of the classes here are initialized internally, and shouldn't be initialized by hand.
All the classes that have a notice saying to not initialize them are initialized according to Discord's API.\
Therefore, the input parameters may vary drastically compared to the properties the class has.

Anyway, there are no docs here.
