DESCRIPTION ---
    Represents  an object that  hasn't  actually been  created yet  via URL,
    useful for  objects that shouldn't have any infinite recursions or if it
    would    take    too    long    to     grab    an    object    normally.

    NOTE: If  you  want to  make a class  that says  not to, it  is OKAY  to
          initialize that class in this way. However, it will not be able to
          be  located in any  part of this module  unless you use this line:
          `bot.listeners.<type eg 'channels'>[<id>] = obj`

          If you want to make a class using URLs, use the following instead:
          `await bot.make(<type eg 'channels'>, <id>, <url>)`

          Types: Channels

PARAMS ---
    id [int]
    - The ID of the object

    url [str]
    - The URL of where to get this data

    typ [Class]
    - The object to be created

    bot [Bot]
    - The bot object

    **fmt [any]
    - How to format the URL, not needed tho
    - Is just `url.format(**fmt)', so do what you want with that
    - NOTE: The `id' kwarg is autofilled

FUNCTIONS ---
    thing = Raw(id, url, typ, bot, **fmt)
    - Create a Raw object

    await thing.get()
    - Generate the object and return it, must be awaited or it
      will not work
    - Will return the object if it has already been generated

    await thing.update()
    - Updates the object via the URL

    thing()
    - Returns the object as is
