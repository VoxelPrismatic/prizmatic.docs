DESCRIPTION ---
    Makes a list of consecutive items that match a class

PARAMS ---
   typ [class]
   - The class in question

USAGE ---
    This is not a regular class. It must be used as follows:

        def function(arg1: AllOf[class]):
            ...

        def fun(arg0, arg1: AllOf[class], ...):
            ...

    This is a parameter class that forms a list of all consecutive
    arguments that match its class parameter. It is mainly used with
    commands for arguments and things.

DESCRIPTION ---
    Has a default value but can be changed

PARAMS ---
    typ [class]
    - The class

USAGE ---
    This is not a regular class. It must be used as follows:

        def function(arg1: Option[class] = default_value):
            ...

        def fun(arg0, arg1: Option[class] = default_value, ...):
            ...

    This is a parameter class that forms an optional argument and will not
    break when an invalid param is passed [when the command is called]. It is
    mainly used with commands for arguments and things.

DESCRIPTION ---
    Can be any of these values

PARAMS ---
    *typ [class]
    - The classes, as a list

USAGE ---
    This is not a regular class. It must be used as follows:

        def function(arg1: Any[class1, class2, ...]):
            ...

        def fun(arg0, arg1: Any[class1, class2, ...] = default_value, ...):
            ...

    This is a parameter class that forms an argument that can have multiple
    forms and will not break as often on a command call. It is mainly used
    with commands for arguments and things.

DESCRIPTION ---
    Allows for equations

PARAMS ---
    *fns [str]
    - Allowed functions, at least one must be specified

USAGE ---
    This is not a regular class. It must be used as follows:

        def function(arg1: Equation[operator]):
            ...

        def fun(arg0, arg1: Any[op1, op2, ...] = default_value, ...):
            ...

    Operators can be '+', '-', or any operator or function because it is a
    string. It is mainly used with commands for arguments and things.
